           The Darce choke

     The Darce choke is a particularly tight form of an arm triangle. It is often used as a counter 
     when your opponent escapes from side control by getting back to their knees. An effective way 
     to finish it is to hook your opponent's legs with your own.

		 	The Darce choke is a variation of an arm triangle. To hit it, thread one of your hands from underneath your training partner's armpits to the far side of their neck. Then, connect to the crook of the elbow of your other arm. Bring the hand of that arm over your training partner's back towards their shoulder. Now, either sprawl or preferably, hook your training partner's foot or hip with your own foot. To finish, squeeze your elbows together and through your opponent's chest. You can also add to the power of the strangulation by rotating your elbow towards your ear, much in the fashion of the rotational method to finish a rear naked choke. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	More often than not, completing these steps leads to a secure controlling position and a strong, satisfying victory. One side of your opponent's neck is barred by your forearm, and the other side is covered by their own shoulder reinforced by the weight of your body. Hit quite often at the highest levels of BJJ and MMA competition, the roots of this excellent move might surprise you. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Like many of the moves of BJJ, there is no doubt that this move had probably been known and used by jujiteros and judokas far before the Gracie era. However, one of the individuals behind the emergence and popularity of this choke in the modern game is none other than John Danaher. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	In his front headlock instructional, Danaher introduces the Darce as the "inverted kata gatame." Classic Danaher, taking one of the coolest submissions and giving it a scientific name, right? Well, turns out he invented it, "in the mid 1990's, when I'd just gotten my blue belt."
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	It wasn't an accident either. Danaher goes on to say how he had noted how most submission in jiu jitsu had an inverted version, but not the kata gatame--the arm triangle. He details how on trying to pass Shawn Williams' open guard, he noticed that the training partner posting on your far shoulder created an opening to create a gable grip at the far side of their neck. Then, using a "three-quarter nelson" move from wrestling to get your opponent's shoulders on the mat, it was possible to "lock up a figure of four" and complete the submission. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Famously, Danaher has never competed. Much like how the immense success of his students Eddie Cummings and Gordon Ryan popularised Danaher's leg lock and straight jacket systems, the name and notoriety of the inverted kata gatame came from another student, Joe D'arce. D'arce's success with this hold in the Califonia tournament scene led to opponent's being wary about the "Darce," and the name stuck. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Interestingly, as an obscure youtube video reveals, D'arce referred not to the submission as the "Darce," but instead the three-quarter nelson movement that breaks the opponent down from turtle onto their side. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	From the front headlock position, Danaher instructs to cut an angle so that you are aligned with your training partner's shoulder line: the line that runs through your partner's two shoulders. Once this has been accomplished, Danaher advises putting your ear on your opponent's back and getting your shoulder below theirs. Then, you use your legs and your elbow to drive your opponent down to their shoulder. Then, without unlocking your hands, and punching the elbow through as much as possible, lock up a figure of four so that your hand goes to your opponent's shoulder. Rotating your elbow across your opponent's neck gets you the strong submission and the tap. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	While darces are often finished by sprawling your body, Danaher advocates stepping over into mount for a position that facilitates the strangle better. Danaher also shows an alternative method of getting into the darce: instead of breaking your training partner down, you may rotate underneath them and still get a strong finishing position. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	Amongst the modern practitioners of Jiu Jitsu, the Ruotolo brothers Kade and Tye are known for making great use of the Darce choke. Tye Ruotolo was able to hit it on Danaher trainee and escape expert Gary Tonon himself in a One Championship full fight. The Ruotolos follow all of the technical points laid out about above, and they also have a unique way of finishing. Instead of breaking down their opponent from turtle, they rotate under to secure the choke and then perform a backwards roll. Then, they stepover or hook the leg to finish. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	A lot of the Ruotolo's entries into darce come from turtle. A fair amount also come from open guard: when the opponent posts and is trying to butt-scoot or stand up away, the Ruotolos will often dive straight into the darce. 
		 	<br>
		 	<br>
		 	The submission is also quite available when you have your training partner in side control and they perform a knee escape. Their underhook presents an opening to go into the choke. Another cool setup opens up when you have your training partner somewhere in between side control and north south. Putting your arm as if you were doing a sort of upside down arm triangle may encourage your training partner to get to their knees: at which point the darce becomes available. 
		 	<br> 
		 	<br>
		 	UFC fans have seen the darce choke hit by the best of the best, including Tony Ferguson, Jorge Masvidal, Dustin Poirier and Chris Weidman. A recent instance of the submission was seen in the fight between Khamzat Chimaev and Kevin Holland. The finishing sequence of this fight was especially instructive. Chimaev was having a lot of trouble finishing the choke using the sprawling finish, and didn't get the tap until he stepped over into mount. Danaher, as usual, knows his stuff.
